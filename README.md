Cipher code app designed to teach and entertain

I was working on this in a private repo, but I decided to make this more of an open-source project. 
The backbone of a decoder app is here, and it employs some features that I did not see in other apps of its kind, such as:
- Synchronous conversion into/from cipher
- Theme selection

I was going to add many more ciphers, as you can see from the different activities! 


This app is not yet published on the app store. If you commit to this repo and items are selected, 
your name will be published as co-authors to this app. 

Enjoy!
